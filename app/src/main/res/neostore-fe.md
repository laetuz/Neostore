# neostore-fe

## 1. Client Identity
- App: neostore-fe
- Version: v0.0.20
- Target Protocol: v1.1
- Target Audience: Legacy Android Devices (Eclair / Froyo / Gingerbread)
- Role: The native portal to browse and install ecosystem APKs.

## 2. Technology Stack & Constraints
- Minimum API: `minSdkVersion 7` (Android 2.1)
- Target API: `targetSdkVersion 21` (Lollipop)
- Language: Java 7
- Network: `HttpURLConnection`, `AsyncTask`, `org.json` (Strictly NO Retrofit/OkHttp)
- UI: Native `ListView` with ViewHolder pattern (Strictly NO RecyclerView/AppCompat-v7)

## 3. Strict Legacy Development Rules (The "Gotchas")
To prevent instant force-closes on API 7, all code must adhere to these historical constraints:
1. String Checking: Never use `String.isEmpty()`. Always use `TextUtils.isEmpty(string)` or `string.length() > 0`.
2. ListView Footers: `listView.addFooterView()` MUST be called strictly *before* `listView.setAdapter()`.
3. Memory Management: `ListView` adapters must implement the `convertView.setTag(viewHolder)` recycling pattern to prevent OutOfMemory crashes on 512MB RAM devices.
4. Downloads: Use the custom `DownloadTask` to stream APKs directly to `Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()`, followed by an `Intent.ACTION_VIEW` to trigger the system Package Installer.
2. No Silent Installs: Legacy apps lack system-level root permissions. Neostore cannot install APKs in the background.
3. The Install Intent:
- Step 1: Download the APK to the device's external storage (`Downloads` folder).
- Step 2: Fire an `ACTION_VIEW` intent with the `application/vnd.android.package-archive` MIME type.
- Step 3: This hands control to the Android OS Package Installer, which prompts the user to confirm the installation.
